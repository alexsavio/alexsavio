## Hey! I'm [@alexsavio](https://twitter.com/alex_savio) (Alexandre M. Savio) 👋

I'm a computer scientist. I use Python and Java mainly these days. 🐍☕

I currently live between the Basque Country (Spain) and Bavaria (Germany). 🌍🇪🇸🇩🇪

I like to design, build and automate things:
    - machine learning, 
    - distributed systems, 
    - data warehouses, 
    - containers, and 
    - serverless.

I also enjoy developing modern backend APIs, chat bots, CI/CD pipelines, and use infrastructure as code for the public cloud providers. 🤖

I am currently helping a limited number of teams and organizations as an **external consultant**. At the same
time I'm learning Rust 🦀 and building business ideas to be able to help more teams to work together.

If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to **contact me**. 🤓

### A bit about me...

I hold a PhD in machine learning applied to brain image processing and disease detection.

During my research I have been using Matlab and Python, scikit-learn and the [Nipy](https://nipy.org/)
tools to pre-process brain images for feature extraction and disease detection from
magnetic resonance (MRI) and positron-emission tomography (PET) images. 🇪🇸🇬🇧🇵🇱🇩🇪

Then I left academia...

Since 2017 I have been involved in a wide variety of projects in small teams in different companies:

- Ansible to provision remote clusters with Kafka and the ElasticSearch stack,
- widely used Java library for logging through Kafka for the automotive industry,
- C++ to automate a Universal Robot to use as a ground truth for motion sensors,
- Python and Falcon to create an IoT end-user facing API for users, devices, and firmwares running on AWS,
- Serverless Framework, Terraform and later AWS CDK to create AWS Step Functions to ingest data into Redshift and S3 for a data warehouse, and
- Golang and OpenAPI to implement integration tests for an end-user facing API.

I also have been participate in the European Python community since 2014:
- co-founded [ACPySS](https://github.com/PythonSanSebastian) to support the Python community,
- PSF Fellow and member of the EuroPython Society Board,
- core organizer of the PySS conferences, EuroPython 2015 and 2016, and EuroScipy 2019 through ACPySS,
- helped in the organization of other EuroScipy, PyMunich and PyConDE, and
- speaker in scientific conferences and also a few Python conferences like PySS, PyData/PyCon Italy, PyConDE, and EuroPython.

A useful tool that I created to generate badges for conferences which ended up being popular among some
friends: [docstamp](https://github.com/PythonSanSebastian/docstamp) and [tito-docstamp](https://github.com/PythonSanSebastian/tito-docstamp).

I created [**hansel**](https://github.com/alexsavio/hansel) as a tool to help with my research and other open source tools. 🚀
